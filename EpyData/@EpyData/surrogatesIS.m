function surro = surrogatesIS(this, opt)
%SURROGATESIS Generate surrogate interictal spike (IS) frequency time series.
%
%   surro = SURROGATESIS(obj) returns the true IS frequency time series for
%   all rats and all states, binned in 1-hour intervals by default.
%
%   surro = SURROGATESIS(obj, opt) allows specification of several options
%   for rat selection, brain state, bin size, and surrogate generation.
%   If surrogate generation is requested, the function returns a shuffled
%   version of the IS time series by permuting large time blocks, preserving
%   long-term structure such as circadian rhythms.
%
%   This method is particularly useful to assess the statistical relevance
%   of observed IS fluctuations by comparison with null distributions that
%   preserve coarse temporal dynamics but destroy fine-grained structure.
%
%   INPUT:
%     obj         : EpyData object containing telemetry or Neuropixels data.
%     opt         : (optional) struct with the following fields:
%       - rat         : [N x 1] double array of rat IDs. Default: all available.
%       - state       : string, "all" | "sleep" | "wake". Default: "all".
%       - binCount    : scalar, bin size in seconds to count the IS frequency. Default: 3600 (1 hour).
%       - range       : scalar, total duration in seconds to extract ([] = full : go to rangeCutIS). Default: [].
%       - nSurro      : integer â‰¥ 0, number of surrogates to generate per rat.
%                       If 0, return real IS frequency only. Default: 100.
%       - binShuffle  : scalar > 0, size in seconds of blocks to permute when
%                       generating surrogates. Default: 86400 (1 day).
%
%   OUTPUT:
%     surro      : Cell array of size [N x 1], one cell per rat.
%                  If nSurro > 0: each cell contains a [T x nSurro] matrix,
%                  where T is the number of bins.
%                  If nSurro == 0: each cell contains a [T x 1] vector of the real IS rate.
